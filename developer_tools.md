##Frameworks
- HTML/CSS - this may be obvious but try and master these before moving on to anything else.
- React js - framework created by facebook for dynamically creating websites 
- React Native just like React but used for making mobile (android, iOS) apps
- angular - similar to react but pushed by google. I feel like this is on the way out and React is currently the big dog.
- Databases
	-  mongodb - great at creating simple objects
	-  sql - great at relating TONS of data together
	-  firebase - kinda like mongodb but hosted by a private company. I would go this route for any new smaller project. I think you can mostly use it for free.
- git - a decentralized way to share and store your code/projects. Github is a free site you can use. Most of the projects on there are open source and you will use them like crazy.
- Learning
	 - udemy.com (Stephen Grider is the man) - PAID
	 - tons of stuff on youtube  - FREE
	 - khan academy - FREE
     - egghead.io - PAID (some free stuff)
	 - Treehouse - PAID (some of the starter stuff is free)
     - Sometimes reading the documentation is the best source
